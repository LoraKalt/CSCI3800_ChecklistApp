## Project Description
Checklist app is a to-do-list for everyday needs. Users can create new tasks, modify existing ones, and delete. Creating a task is easy, with each task, user can specify the urgency of the task and optionally what date does the task need to be done. Once created, the user can view this task and are given the option to edit the task or to delete it instead.

Once the user has a list of tasks, they then can sort them by oldest-to-newest based on creation order; by date, with most upcoming dates on top; and by priority, with most urgent on top of the list. Clicking on these sorting options, every time the user creates a new task, it will automatically be sorted in the given order.

Clicking the checkbox indicates that the task is completed. If there are several completed tasks, the user has the option to delete all checked tasks to clear up their list.
Every change the user makes to the checklist will be saved on the database so that when the return to the app, theyâ€™ll be able to see their created list from the last session.
